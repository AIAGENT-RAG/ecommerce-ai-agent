## 🔍 Methodology

### 🧠 Step 1 — Query Understanding  
The user’s search query (e.g., “laptop”, “mobile”, “headphones”) is embedded using **sentence-transformers** to capture semantic meaning.

### 🔎 Step 2 — Product Matching  
The recommender computes similarity scores between the query and product embeddings, retrieving the top matches.

### 💬 Step 3 — Explanation Generation  
Each recommendation is passed to **Gemini AI**, which generates a natural language explanation describing why it’s a good fit.

### 🎨 Step 4 — Frontend Display  
All results are displayed in a clean, card-based layout with product images, price, category, and explanations.
